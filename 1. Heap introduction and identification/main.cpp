/*
1)A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. .

/*

1. k

2. smallest/ largest

k + smallest => maxheap => maximm elements upar
k + largest => minheap => minimum elements upar


all heap quesstiona are heap ques inly => n log n TC becomes n log k
